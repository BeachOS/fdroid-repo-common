Summary: Aurora Store Privileged Extension
Description: |
    IMPORTANT: Install this update to prevent app uninstallation when
    Aurora Store 4.0.6 tries to update them.

    Aurora Services allow you to install updates in the background
    without having to confirm. This is the BeachOS version of Aurora
    Services.

    You will still need to confirm app installs and uninstalls, only
    updates are allowed without confirmation in this version.
